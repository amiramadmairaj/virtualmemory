Virtual Memory Simulator
Project Overview
This repository hosts a Virtual Memory Simulator, written in C, designed to simulate the operations of a virtual memory system with page fault handling and page replacement algorithms. This project includes the implementation of both FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and LRU (Least Recently Used) page replacement strategies.

Key Features
Simulates a virtual memory system with 128 addresses and 16 pages.
Implements FIFO and LRU page replacement algorithms for efficient memory management.
Provides a command-line interface for reading/writing to virtual memory and viewing memory and page table states.
